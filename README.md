# AdventurWorks-Cycles-Business-Analysis-Dashboard


 I'm excited to share the valuable insights from my recent Power BI project, focused on Adventure Works Cycles, a global manufacturing company in the cycling equipment and accessories industry.
The Adventure Works Cycles management team needed a robust solution to track essential performance metrics like sale, revenue, profit, and returns. Additionally, they wanted to compare regional performance, analyze product trends, and identify high-value customers. To address these needs, I created an interactive dashboard with four insightful reports.

Report 1- Performance Overview:
The first report showcase important metrics using visually appealing card visual. Revenue, profit, orders, and return rate are clearly presented. I've added a stacked bar chart to display order by category, providing an insightful view of product performance. To enrich the user experience, I included a custom tooltip that shows details such as total order, profit, revenue, and return rate over time. Additionally, a table containing the top 10 product help identify best-selling item. KPI card compare monthly revenue, order, and return with previous month, while a line chart analyze revenue trends over time. Two extra card reveal the subcategories with maximum order and those with more returned orders.

Report 2- Regional Insights:
In this report, I incorporated map visuals to visualize the countries and their total orders. A convenient slicer panel allows users to filter data based on continents, providing a understanding of AdventureWorks' global sales distribution and identifying potential growth areas.

Report 3 - Customer Analysis:
Next, I delved into customer-related factors, providing metrics like total customer and average revenue per customer using card visuals. The report highlights the top 100 customer based on revenue and presents orders categorized by income level and occupation using donut chart. A line chart with dynamic field parameter shows how customers and revenue per customer evolved over time. The card visual also display vital information about top customers, helping the management team focus on high-value clients.

Report 4 - Product Performance:
In this, three gauges illustrate monthly orders, revenue, and profit against target. Red callout values flag areas needing improvement, while grey represents achieved target. Two line charts provide further insights, estimating profit within -1 to 1 range and displaying essential metrics like orders, revenue, profit, returns, and return rate. Empowering the management team with crucial product insight

Interactivity and Navigation:
Throughout the project, I've prioritized a seamless user experience with bookmarks, customized buttons, and slicer panel, enabling easy filtering and navigation across the reports. This ensures clear insights and smooth exploration, allowing the management team to make informed, data-driven decisions.
